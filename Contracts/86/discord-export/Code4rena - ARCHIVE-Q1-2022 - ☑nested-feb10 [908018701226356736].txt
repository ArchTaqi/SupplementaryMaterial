Absolutely!! 
So, as mentioned in the README file : 

```

Note : The Beta is running on the v1 (puzzle) of the protocol. The version of this contest is the v2 (lego).
```

Also ! If you have any "frustrations" reading the code, like bad nomenclature, structure, missing/inconsistent doc,... (that are not issues)
We really want to know ! Feel free to be salty  🙂

@Adrien | Nested @axxe the `package.json` file is missing


[09-Feb-22 11:36 PM] axxe#8561
Fixed 🙂

Hello everyone!

Be careful with this second audit, we will "dispute" all the issues that were already surfaced in the previous audit => https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-nested-findings

I just added the mention to emphasize this point, even though the first audit was already mentioned in the README.md 😀

Are the tests supposed to be working? Seems like there is outdated stuff there, for examples fixtures.ts imports DummyRouter from ../../typechain but that file is not in the repo anymore


[10-Feb-22 06:23 AM] geopok20216#4651
It takes time to check if an issue matches a previous one. Shouldn't it only be ones in the readme?


[10-Feb-22 06:26 AM] Kenzo Agada#5926
I think there's no difference for us wardens between them saying "stuff from previous audit will be disputed" and between them manually adding all the stuff from previous audit to the readme file

It will be probably good to mention in the readme that issues from first audit will be disputed though


[10-Feb-22 06:28 AM] geopok20216#4651
It's a matter of skimming a single page vs opening every issue to confirm


[10-Feb-22 06:28 AM] ⛅CloudEllie#4509
Hi all - might help to review the report instead: https://code4rena.com/reports/2021-11-nested/

You can just skim the final report no? That's what they linked to above here


[10-Feb-22 06:29 AM] geopok20216#4651
Duplicates often are slightly different and aren't listed


[10-Feb-22 06:30 AM] ⛅CloudEllie#4509
Hmm, I may have a solution for this.


[10-Feb-22 06:45 AM] axxe#8561
Try running git pull and yarn typechain. Let me know if it's better now 🙂


[10-Feb-22 06:47 AM] Kenzo Agada#5926
Fixed that one, but few others seem to be there -

[10-Feb-22 06:55 AM] axxe#8561
OKKK By selecting the files in the scope and not cloning the repo I skipped some files... 
I just added the missing utils.ts file


[10-Feb-22 06:55 AM] axxe#8561
should be ok, thank you for your feedback


[10-Feb-22 06:59 AM] Kenzo Agada#5926

After running `yarn` and `yarn typechain`  it works. Did you run these two commands?
